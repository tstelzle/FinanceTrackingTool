# Finance Tracking Tool FTT

The idea of this project is to build a simple tool to help you with your finances.
The tool should get a picture of a receipt, later from an app, and then read the contents on it. 
The date, the store, the article and the price on the receipt should then be stored in a database. 
Further information like a category should also be added to the database entry.
If the article is not known yet, there should be a request to add the additional information. 

Later on there should be an app from which the photos of a receipt can be send to the server. 
The app should also be able to list results from a query on the database.

In a next step there should be a web tool, which should have the same, if not more, features as the app.
Additional features could be plotting graphs of the database entries.
